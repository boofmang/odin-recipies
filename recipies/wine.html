    <li>1 large onion</li>

    <li>250 ml double cream</li>
    <li>1 bunch dill</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>First, dice the onions and garlic, get them simmering in a saucepan with a little oil until soft</li>
    <li>Add in the lemon juice first, shortly followed by the white wine, have the heat at a medium and allow this to reduce by half</li>
    <li>When the wine has reduced, add in the cream, stir through and allow to simmer away until it has reduced to a thickness you desire </li>
    <li>Lastly chop the dill and toss into the sauce, stir through and then add salt to taste</li>
